(You should complete Self-Check 8.7 before answering this question. You may also want to consult your solution to Self-Check 8.11 and/or 8.15.)

Add a constructor to the Name class that accepts a first name, middle initial, and last name as parameters (in that order) and initializes the Name object's state with those values.

(You don't need to write the class header or declare the fields; assume that this is already done for you. Just write your constructor's complete code in the box provided.)
