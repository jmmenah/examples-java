/*
Add methods named setX and setY to the Point class. Each method accepts an integer parameter and changes the Point object's x- or y-coordinate to be the value passed, respectively.

Your code is being added to the following class:

public class Point {

    int x;

    int y;

    

    // // your code goes here

    

}

(You don't need to write the class header or declare the fields; assume that this is already done for you. Just write your methods' complete code in the box provided.)
